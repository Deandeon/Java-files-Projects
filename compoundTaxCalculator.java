 * PLANNING/STEPS
 * Principal - your original investment (500)

Rate - Interest rate - 28.8854

peroids per year- No of perirods for your investment to occur (Eg. In the example it said 3 months = 5 % since 20/4 = 5

Deposit = roll over( added money to the investment eg (Â¢100 every three
months after the initial investment (so in April, July and October 2023) = 100 *3 =300 )

total periods = No of times the period would cuumulate over (Quarterly , montly. half yearly)
 
500- january - april investment
36.105625 - J-A interest

 Interest for this - A-J interest - 45
(536.105625 +100 = 636.105625) - A - J Investment

782.04- J- O investment
56 - J-O interest

938.6859506- O-J investments   etc # note that some of these calculations are wrong
56 - OJ interest

total periods = no of periods eg 3



Return
- Total value (Amount)

-Interest = (Amount - Principal invested)
where principal invested = ( Original principal * (No of deposits added) *( the fix deposit)
